        display:inline
                    When an element is styled with display:inline, it will not start on a new line, will only take up as much width as the content it contains, and will not cause a line break after it. 

                        <span class="highlight">inline-level element</span>

        display:inline-block
                   The inline-block element does not start on a new line, but it takes up the specified width and height.   
                                          li {
                                            display: inline-block;
                                            font-size: 20px;
                                            padding: 20px;
                                            }

        display:block
                    Any element styled with display: block is the polar opposite of display:inline. A block element starts on a new line and occupies the available width of its parent element or its specified width. 
                    The HTML [p], [div], as well as other elements listed here are block elements by default.    

                               <div>
                                    <p>
                                    This the first paragraph. The background color of these paragraphs have been
                                     colored to distinguish them from their parent element.</p>

                                    <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>

                                </div>
