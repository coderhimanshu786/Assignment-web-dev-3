CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

Categories into :

1- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
syntax
                                p {
                                text-align: center;
                                color: red;
                                }

2- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    syntax-
                                            h1 {
                                            text-align: center;
                                            color: red;
                                            }

                                            h2 {
                                            text-align: center;
                                            color: red;
                                            }

                                            p {
                                            text-align: center;
                                            color: red;
                                            }

3- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    syntax
                                    Selector:Pseudo-Class {
                                    Property: Value;
                                }
                               
                                h1:hover{
                                       background-color: aqua;
                                        }

4- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    syntax                 
                Selector:Pseudo-Element{
                                        Property:Value;
                                    }
                                    
                                    p::first-line{
                                        background-color: goldenrod;
                                    }

5- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    syntax 
                        [href] {
                                background-color: lightgreen;
                                color: black;
                                font-family: monospace;
                                font-size: 1rem;
                            }

Advantages of css selector-

1- Simple syntax since they include a single element in their structure.

2- Performance is the same or faster compared to XPath.

3- Easier to learn than XPath, easier to use.
